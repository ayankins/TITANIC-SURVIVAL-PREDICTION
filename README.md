# Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The project employs a Logistic Regression model to analyze and predict survival rates based on passenger data.

## Overview

This project aims to provide an accurate prediction of survival outcomes for passengers aboard the Titanic by utilizing a Logistic Regression model. The model is trained on key features such as age, gender, ticket class, and more to determine the likelihood of a passenger surviving the disaster.

## Features

- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Explore the Titanic dataset using various data visualization techniques.
- **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess data to improve model accuracy.
- **Model Training**: Utilize Logistic Regression for predictive modeling.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy.
